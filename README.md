# ðŸ§¬ Histopathologic Cancer Detection with Deep Learning

This project implements deep learning models for binary classification of metastatic tissue in histopathologic images. It is inspired by the [Kaggle Histopathologic Cancer Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection) and demonstrates practical, scalable methods for digital pathology in oncology â€” a field of key interest in precision medicine.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

To develop a clean, interpretable pipeline for classifying histopathologic Whole Slide Image (WSI) patches as cancerous or non-cancerous using:

- Baseline CNNs trained from scratch
- Transfer learning with pretrained ResNet18
- Full data preprocessing, normalization, and evaluation

---

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle Competition
- **Images**: 96x96 `.tif` RGB tiles extracted from WSIs
- **Labels**: 0 = no cancer, 1 = metastatic cancer
- **Size Used**: 10,000 samples (balanced across classes)

---

## ðŸ§  Models

### âœ… Baseline CNN (PyTorch)
- 2 convolutional layers + max pooling
- Fully connected classifier with dropout
- Input: 96x96 images
- Performance:
  - Accuracy: **79.5%**
  - AUC: **0.87**

### âœ… ResNet18 (Transfer Learning)
- Pretrained on ImageNet
- Final FC layers replaced for binary output
- Inputs resized to 224x224 + normalization
- Performance:
  - Accuracy: **86.1%**
  - AUC: **0.928**
